Hello! 
I am a first-year Ph.D. student at Northeastern University's [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) where I am advised by [Prof. Rose Yu](http://roseyu.com/).
My research interests broadly lie in the fields of tensor methods, deep learning, and optimization. 
I am especially interested in developing algorithms to learn faster by leveraging the structure of data without losing too much accuracy.

Before coming to Northeastern, I worked as a software engineer and systems administrator at [Samsung Electronics](https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/) in the semiconductor division.
I administered the internal cloud platform's infrastructure and helped expand it to multiple sites and received the Achievement Prize for my work. I also dabbled with containerization and Kubernetes. I implemented a new ETL tool for manufacturing data and developed APIs and client libraries for big data analysis of manufacturing data.

I graduated from [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en) with the M.S and B.S. degrees in Industrial Systems Engineering. 
During my M.S., I researched prediction models for complex semiconductor tools and focused on the tradeoff between accuracy and computation. 
I developed a new prediction model that is accurate and generalizes well, with little extra computational complexity.
